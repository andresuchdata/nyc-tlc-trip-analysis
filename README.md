# Capstone Project 2 - NYC Taxi Trip Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze NYC taxi trip data to gain insights into the taxi industry and the factors that influence taxi trip duration. The analysis will cover data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is NYC TLC Trip Record Data (mainly on January 2023). Please download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BrwXX6G5cAJy4dSTlLiDdfjVJzjxx49r/view?usp=sharing).

Please download first and put it in same directory as `app.ipynb`, before running the Jupyter Notebook. 

## Setup
1. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `app.ipynb`

## Summary

This application is a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes NYC taxi trip data to gain insights into the taxi industry and the factors that influence taxi trip duration.

Outline of the analysis:

1. Setup Data and Importing Libraries
2. Detailed Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis

In the exploratory data analysis part, we see several factors and the insights for each factor.

## Demo

You can run the Jupyter Notebook on Binder or Google Colab. Please try it out!
